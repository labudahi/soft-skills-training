Competencies

- Curiosity
- Growth Mindset
- Communication
- Teamwork

## Curiosity

The candidate's curiosity drives them to learn more. They're excited by the possibility of growing, and by the possibility of improving the product for its users & business potential or technological potential.

Curiosity does not have to be code- or industry-related. A demonstrated curiosity about, for example (and without limitation), their family genealogy, a foreign culture, cuisine, the mechanics of windmills, literary history, biomechanics etc. are all interesting.

**Sample questions**

- Why do you want to work at \$COMPANY?
- How do you keep up to date with tech?
- Do you have any side projects or contributions to open source?

🤦‍♂️ Strong No

- The candidate demonstrates no interest in \$COMPANY, or in the world around them, and provides no evidence that they want to learn more.

🙅🏿‍♂️ No

- The candidate isn’t able to describe any self-directed learning or meaningful areas of our product/company that they are curious about.

- They accept every statement at face value, without digging in. They ask no questions.

🤷🏻‍♀️ Mixed

- The candidate asked, “why?” once or twice, but isn’t particularly interested in the impact the answers have in the product and for the customer. They don't go deeper.

- The questions the candidate asks are fairly standard, on topics like tech stack, or working hours, without really seeking any deep insight. The product ideas that the candidate has are equally standard/uninspiring/lack depth.

- The candidate has done a little self-directed learning on a topic that interests them.

👍 Yes

- The candidate asks insightful questions about \$COMPANY.

- They ask follow-up questions to go deeper on topics. Their questions uncover the impact to the product, the customer, or the candidate's curiosity.

- They describe times when they have done independent research, on any topic.

- They have interesting ideas for our product or questions about our users.

- The candidate describes needing to figure out why something was broken, and derives satisfaction from finding answers.

💯 Strong Yes

- The candidate displays an insatiable appetite for learning, provides ample evidence of self-improvement and asking questions, and gets excited when they recognise an opportunity for improving the product, impacting customers, and learning.

- The candidate runs out of time asking questions, and still has more to ask.

## Growth Mindset

We want candidates who know themselves, who will respond well to feedback, and who are self-aware enough to know what their deficiencies are and seek to work with those who can support them.

It will typically be hard to make a call on this in a purely technical interview. However, it is instructive to see how the candidate responds when bugs with their code are pointed out. An inability to recognise or accept a mistake can be problematic. Contrariwise, responding well to a bug with humour and good grace is a good sign.

**Sample questions**

- Tell me about a major mistake you made, and what you did to correct it.

🤦‍♂️ Strong No

- The candidate demonstrates a significant lack of self-awareness and of introspection.

- The candidate fails to meaningfully identify any ways in which they could improve.

- The candidate uncritically gives themselves a 10/10 for performance at all their past positions.

- The candidate demonstrates no interest in receiving feedback.

🙅🏿‍♂️ No

- When asked to identify opportunities for improvement, the candidate gives false-modest answers like “sometimes I work too hard.”

- They can’t identify their performance at a previous position relative to their peers.

- They don’t know how their manager would rate them, or why.

- They have rejected concrete feedback in the past, and were unable to see why it was offered.

🤷🏻‍♀️ Mixed

- "The candidate recognises that they can improve, but speaks in vague terms that demonstrate a lack of significant thought on the matter.

- The candidate is ambivalent about receiving feedback.

- The candidate is unable to articulate a time when receiving feedback, or self-analysis, helped them become better.

👍 Yes

- "The candidate describes a time when they received critical feedback, and were able to integrate it to become better.

- They make reflective statements like “I was immature”, or “I wasn’t willing to compromise”, or “I’ve learned that getting buy-in from others is important”.

- The candidate knows themselves, and has thought about how they can improve.

- The candidate made deliberate career choices in response to past experiences.

💯 Strong Yes

- "The candidate is able to critique their own past performance and identify a number of growth opportunities.

- They compare their past selves with their current selves unflinchingly, and identify areas where they have improved and the steps they took.

- The candidate is aware that they make mistakes and demonstrates a desire to learn from them.

- The candidate speaks objectively about their own shortcomings and describes strategies for mitigating them.

- They are eager to receive feedback, and demand it.

## Communication

Communication is very broad, and can cover presentation skills, verbal communication, an ability to explain new concepts clearly, written communication, slide decks, data visualisations, gesticulations with hands, listening, asking clarifying questions, and expectation-setting. Communication styles vary widely among candidates; you should focus on whether they are able to get their point across, and able to accurately interpret your questions.

Some people are naturally less communicative than others when speaking to strangers, and especially in interviews. You should assess them on the entirety of their communicative ability, not just their ability to talk fast and off the cuff. It’s fine to coax more out of a person, and/or give them time to warm up. Whenever possible, ask open questions to give the candidate the opportunity to talk.

**Sample questions**

- Tell me about the last time your workday ended before you were able to get everything done.
- Tell me about a time you had to raise an uncomfortable issue with your boss.

🤦‍♂️ Strong No

- The candidate does not ask any questions, and doesn’t listen. They solve the wrong problem as a result.

- The candidate is incapable of describing a concept or topic even when they are intimately familiar with it (unless — in truly exceptional cases — the topic is so complicated that the interviewer lacks the context necessary to understand it).

- The candidate cannot clearly communicate their intentions or thought process, even after significant encouragement and prodding.

🙅🏿‍♂️ No

- The candidate’s intent is frequently unclear. When writing code, the interviewer frequently finds themselves in a position where they cannot in good faith say what the candidate is attempting to do, or why. The candidate cuts the interviewer off frequently.

- The candidate is reluctant to offer anything more than one or two word answers, or writes in fragments that don’t particularly make sense.

- The candidate needs a frequent re-framing of a problem to understand it.

- The cannot adequately explain why they chose the approach they took.

🤷🏻‍♀️ Mixed

- The candidate needs to say things multiple times to get their point across to a good faith listener.

- The candidate can communicate an idea at a high level, but lacks precision and nuance in the details.

- The candidate “handwaves” complex parts of code despite being prodded to expound.

- They are unable to describe a time where they convinced someone of something, or used language to influence something.

👍 Yes

- When solving a problem, the candidate asks questions to clarify needs, and is able to describe an approach at a high-level. They describe how their code works, unprompted. They are able to communicate complex topics to a layperson.

- The candidate clearly imparts knowledge and concepts through appropriate means, including, but not limited to, diagrams, body movement, writing and speech. When explaining something, the candidate talks at a level appropriate to their audience.

- The candidate describes a time where their communication influenced a decision.

💯 Strong Yes

- The candidate frequently checks understanding when explaining a complex concept, and if there is any misunderstanding, is able to unpack the problem and effectively communicate the necessary information.

- The candidate finds the precise word they want to convey the exact meaning they need (even if they takes a few seconds to do so).

- They are able to explain with great precision why they took the steps they did on a project. The candidate has put together cases that persuade a skeptical audience.

## Teamwork

If a candidate has worked exclusively in very small teams, much of this might be theoretical. In technical interviews, judge the candidate on their ability to use you for your knowledge, and willingness to ask for help. Pay attention to how they describe their role on previous teams, and whether they are comfortable sharing credit and accepting blame.

**Sample questions**

- Tell me about a time you knew you were right, but still had to follow directions or guidelines.

🤦‍♂️ Strong No

- The candidate describes themselves as a loner, doing their best work alone.

- Demonstrates no understanding of the value of working within teams and cannot describe a time where working with others was beneficial.

- The candidate is suspicious, generally, of “teamwork” as a concept.

- The candidate describes people with whom they disagree as, for example, “stupid”

🙅🏿‍♂️ No

- The candidate describes successes as “I”, but describes failures as “we”.

- The candidate does not like working with others.

- They do not make use of the interviewer when they are stuck and trying to solve a

- The candidate fails to solicit input from teammates.

- The candidate describes situations in terms like “us vs them”, dismissing those with whom there are disagreements as “other”.

🤷🏻‍♀️ Mixed

- The candidate describes working with others, albeit with some reluctance.

- They demonstrate a limited capability to work on a problem with others.

- They ask some questions, though conversation on a problem falls short of a meaningful dialog.

👍 Yes

- The candidate is happy working with others to achieve an outcome.

- The candidate employs a collaborative approach to problem solving, soliciting feedback, and integrating it into their solution.

- The candidate brings others with them.

- The candidate does not merely hand out tasks, and is not satisfied with merely receiving tasks to complete.

💯 Strong Yes

- The candidate demonstrates repeated examples of working with others to achieve a desired outcome.

- They are eager to work with others.

- The candidate describes times where other people provided skills that they were lacking.

- Describes achievements as “we” as appropriate (though taking individual credit for their specific contribution is fine).
